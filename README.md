# FunWithPython
Being a noob in programming, I have decided to excel my coding skill by coding daily for the rest of the year. And, in this journey, I have chosen Python 3.7 as my companion. FunWithPython is such a project by a newbie python programmer, who wants to expertise the subject by experimenting crazy ideas and implementing that with the help of python in his leisure hours ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ . However, this is DAY int(False), hour int(True). Lets get started.
